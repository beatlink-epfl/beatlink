# BeatLink
**BeatLink** is the ultimate social music experience, bridging the gap between music lovers 
and their surroundings. Whether you’re curious about the songs playing around you or want to 
create the perfect collaborative playlist, BeatLink makes music truly social.

# Features
- Music on the map: See what songs people are listening to around you and connect with them 
through your shared love for the same music.
- Collaborative playlists: Create playlists with collaborators, let them vote for their favorite 
tracks and export the playlist featuring the top-voted songs to Spotify for your next party.

# Disclaimer
Please note that this project requires a Spotify Premium account to use the full functionality of the app.
If you don't own a Spotify Premium account, you can still create a BeatLink account, but you won't be able to use any of the features as they are all Spotify-related.  
If you do own a Spotify Premium account, but the features appear not to be working, please make sure that your Spotify account is linked to the app (Profile -> Settings -> Account settings).
